        <p>
            Mam,
            <br><br>
            I am writing to inform you that I am currently suffering from a fever and, as a result, 
            <br>I am unable to attend [work/school] for the next few days. I believe it is best for 
            <br>my recovery and to prevent spreading illness to others.
            <br>
            I kindly request leave starting from [20th sep,2024] to [22nd sep,2024]. 
            <br>I will keep you updated on my condition and hope to return as soon as I am well enough.
            <br>
            Thank you for your understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sincerely,
            <br>Nandha Vinayak A P,
         </p>
